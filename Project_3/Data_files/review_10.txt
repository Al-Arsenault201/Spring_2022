There’s a good message here but it’s muddled with suggestions something more going on that isn’t The truth is worse than a Disney villain it’s gaslighting by and from people who were assumed trustworthy or having ones back Villains lie to heroes and heroines all the time it’s what they do, after all but how does one forgive a knowingly false accusation and turning everyone against them with all the hurt that would cause If the filmmakers had embraced this as the actual theme from the beginning, it’d have made more sense and been a completely different movie but did the filmmakers even realize what they’d done in the end It makes one wonder if an alternate ending  with Mirabel washing her hands of the Family Madrigal and hiking off to Brazil  might be an extra for the home release.
