Disney’s Encanto boasts two standout musical numbers  with lyrics and music by Lin Manuel Miranda  but it’s telling that one of them centers on a minor supporting character and could be easily excised from the story proper Written by Charise Castro Smith and Jared Bush  Encanto takes on a complicated  mature topic—multigenerational family dysfunction—and dramatizes it in ways that are simultaneously literal and metaphorical  which is something only the best of Pixar usually manages to pull off Here  the result is at once limited and meandering  underexplored and overstuffed The central character  among many  is Mirabel    voiced by Stephanie Beatriz      a teenager who lives with her grandmother and other extended family members in a magically sentient house in Colombia Soon into the film  however  the magic begins to fade  including the related powers    strength  shape shifting  etc     that have been granted to every family member except Mirabel Is she to blame? Things get more emotionally and narratively convoluted from there  which is maybe why the cleanly delineated    and exuberantly animated  in Disney musical style     sequences I mentioned above are such standouts   Surface Pressure    in which Mirabel’s older sister    Jessica Darrow     confesses to feeling burdened by familial expectations  could be a movie of its own And   We Don’t Talk About Bruno    a comedic ensemble number about Mirabel’s black sheep uncle  lightens the proceedings with visual and musical wit Both numbers have the hip hop inflected showtune spirit that has become a familiar signature of Miranda’s work  but still feels fresh and invigorating here Encanto could have used more of that and less oppressive narrative
