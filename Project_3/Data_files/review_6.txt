Beautiful movie  The animation and textures were gorgeous  I love the little details incorporated in Casita and the characters themselves  Story wise the film fell very flat for me  There were too many characters and no real consequences for any of them  They lose and regain their abilities within a few minutes  Maribel is neglected her entire life and forced to live in a nursery, because her grandma can't accept that her not getting powers is her fault    but its okay we will just brush that abuse under the rug
