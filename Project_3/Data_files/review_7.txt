While it has a stand-out song We Don't Talk About Bruno and a good message, the delivery is undercut by crippling structural issues, a rushed ending, and a lack of characterization when it needed it most  It's not clear if this was a movie that suffered on the cutting room floor or if it was simply on a tight schedule, but either way, this arepa is underbaked  The cast isn't too large, but it feels large when every single character is introduced in the opening song of the movie  If exposition dumps came in the form of a song, it'd look like this  This is also another Disney attempt at a movie with no villain and a weak act structure  While the grandma is the only one who ever provides conflict for the main character, she's oddly undercharacterized with no song and no clear reason for her scene-to-scene 180 in opinion at the end of the movie  Speaking of which, the final scene at the river seemed like the perfect opportunity for the conflict to come to a head with a song where both characters begin apart, and grow together as they realize they're not opposites at all (being the two who have no Gifts)  Instead, the movie bizarrely retold the same events from the start of the movie, and then magically the characters got over their differences offscreen  The songs suffer from the usual issues with Manuel-Mirandas' poetry  But with the exception of Surface Pressure, it's clear that these shortcomings were smoothed over by collaborating Disney musicians  This goes too far in the other direction too - it's almost a desperate parody when "Let It Go" ('member that? From a decade ago?) appears at the end of the movie  They're both too safe and too flawed at the same time  Overall the movie works to keep kids occupied for 90 minutes, but don't go looking for anything memorable here
