The problems for Encanto lie in a very clunky first half    The setup to the film is rough like an unripened fruit  and it has trouble finding its footing    The film needed a strong sense of the story’s stakes  and the threat or doom the Madrigal family faces could have been better established    In addition  while the village that was granted to the Madrigals by the magic light is lovely and peaceful  it’s also highly isolated    It raises the question of what’s happening outside of the mountains that shield the town    Would losing the magic put the entire town at risk as well? Is it still dangerous outside the mountains? Do any of the Madrigals want to leave their home and see the rest of the world? These are ideas the movie raises but does not fully explore   
Some of the other members of the Madrigal clan seem fun and interesting    Unfortunately  beyond Mirabel and her grandmother  the rest of the family are woefully under developed    It’s a shame because it looks like a lot of effort went into designing and establishing the building blocks for some interesting characters for the Madrigals  but the rest of the relatives are not elevated outside of acting as two dimensional archetypes    Mirabel’s aunt  Pepa (Gaitán)  has weather powers  and she has emotional moods wings    So  Pepa has to keep it together lest their whole town becomes a thunderstorm    Mirabel’s second oldest sister  Luisa (Darrow)  has super strength and does all the town’s heavy lifting    The Madrigals look and sound interesting  but needed additional screentime and development   
When the film finally reintroduces Mirabel’s missing and estranged Uncle  Bruno (Leguizamo)  Encanto starts to click    Bruno appears to possess soothsayer powers that grant him visions of certain futures    The drawback is that his visions are not always positive    Leguizamo is perfectly cast here as the eccentric Uncle Bruno    It’s fun to see him voicing a Disney animated character after his multiple outings as Sid for the Ice Age series  and this is a character where he uses his natural voice    Leguizamo’s Bruno gives the film a nice breath of fresh air and a bit more momentum to the plot   
Encanto is about the anxiety of living up to your family’s expectations    And that’s a good message and theme to explore for this type of feature    Also  Mirabel’s fear and doubt are not unique within her family    Once that becomes the clear focus of the story  Encanto’s narrative begins to recover   
There’s an incredibly heartbreaking and emotional sequence later in the film that shows what the Walt Disney Animation Studio is truly capable of when it’s batting on all cylinders    The film plays like there was significant disharmony during the production  resulting in major story overhauls  which is not unique to Disney or Pixar features    This results in a largely uneven first half    When Encanto progresses deeper into the second act  the gloves come off  and the story provides some powerful imagery   
The other major driving issue that holds Encanto back is the musical comedy format    Lin Manuel Miranda wrote the film’s original songs  which mostly fall flat    Moana may not have hit a home run with all of its songs  but at least the film had a couple of solid winners    Here  the songs are trying  but they lack catchy iconography    There are even a couple of moments where Miranda appears to be trying to channel Frozen‘s  Let It Go     The effort and passion in the music are there  but the qualities that make Disney songs so memorable are missing   
The songs of Encanto aren’t necessarily bad    They just aren’t particularly fun or memorable    Or they swing for the fences without ever really connecting    The soundtrack starts off decently enough with  Welcome to the Family Madrigal   but even that number is a bit iffy    The rest of the songs sounded fairly forgettable   
Overall  Encanto is an entertaining film with a vibrant  exotic look    While the characters are undercooked  they are not without their charm    It’s simply a dish that needed a bit more time in the oven
